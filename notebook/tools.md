* `text.concordance("")` :        shows every occurrence of a given word, together with some context.
* `text.similar("")` :            shows other words appearing in a similar range of contexts.
* `text.common_contexts([""])` :  allows to examine just the contexts that are shared by two or more words.
* `text.dispersion_plot(["", "", ..])` :  allows to examine just the contexts that are shared by two or more words.
* `text.count("")`:               returns the count of how often a word occurs in a text.

**Functions**

* `len(text)` :                   returns the length of something. (A token is the technical name for a sequence of characters.)
